Roles are used to group permission settings together and assign them to users.

Permission settings in roles are not meant to be a 1:1 match to domain permissions.


Visa - A visa is an access control construct that encapsulates the effective permissions of a user by merging permissions granted via roles with those assigned directly at the domain level. This enables flexible and comprehensive authorization management within the application.

Under IAM - Visas bring together domain permissions and role permissions.
