CellixJs documentation features are designed to help developers understand and implement Domain-Driven Design patterns with Azure Functions and modern web technologies.

Here are a few tips to get you started with CellixJs development.

Simply explore the `packages` directory to understand the modular architecture.

Regular contributors can be added to the team through our development workflow.

The project follows semantic versioning and clear release cycles:

- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document key decisions
- Domain contexts are organized under `packages/api-domain/src/domain/contexts/`

CellixJs provides comprehensive examples for DDD implementation:
