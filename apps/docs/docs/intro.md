# Introduction ðŸ‘‹

Let's discover **CellixJs in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **exploring the CellixJs platform**.

CellixJs is a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) monorepo built on Azure Functions, implementing a modular architecture with strict separation of concerns.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 22.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.
- [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local) for local development

    * `func --version`
        * should return 4.0.6610 or greater
    * [Install Guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools#installing)
        * to upgrade: (mac)
        * `brew upgrade azure-functions-core-tools@4`

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) or access to a MongoDB instance

## Clone and Setup

Clone the CellixJs repository and set up the development environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CellixJs/cellixjs.git
cd cellixjs
```



Install dependencies and build the project: (we recommend using NVM)

```bash
# Install Node.js v22
nvm install v22

# Install Latest NPM (v11+)
nvm install-latest-npm

# Use Node.js v22
nvm use v22

# Clean, install dependencies, and build
npm run clean
npm install 
npm run build
```

## Install VSCode plugins
You will be prompted to install the [recommended VSCode Plugins](https://github.com/CellixJs/cellixjs/blob/main/.vscode/extensions.json) upon opening the project in VSCode. Go ahead and do so.

## Local SonarCloud Analysis

- Create a SonarCloud API token from your [SonarCloud account](https://sonarcloud.io/account/security/)
- Run the following command using your token in the terminal

```bash
echo "export SONAR_TOKEN=<your-token>" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Start Development

Run the development environment:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will:
- Build all workspace packages with linting
- Start mock emulator services (Azurite for Azure Storage, MongoDB in-memory replica set, OAuth2/OIDC mock server)
- Launch the backend Azure Functions runtime
- Start the frontend React UI
- Start the documentation site

The development server will be available at:
- **API**: http://localhost:7071 (Azure Functions)
- **GraphQL Playground**: http://localhost:7071/api/graphql
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000 (React UI)
- **Docs**: http://localhost:3001 (Docusaurus)

## Verify Code Quality locally

Run all verification steps (lint, build, test, sonarcloud, quality gate):

```bash
npm run verify
```
 Expected output:
```bash
> ...
> Quality Gate passed.
```

If there are any failing builds, tests, or sonarcloud analysis issues, this command will report them. Please address any issues before pushing code to simulate the CI pipeline and ensure checks will pass on the remote repository.

> Note: The `verify` command requires a valid SONAR_TOKEN environment variable for SonarCloud analysis. See the [Local SonarCloud Analysis](#local-sonarcloud-analysis) section for setup instructions.

## Architecture Overview

CellixJs follows these core patterns:

- **Application Packages**:
    - **API**: Azure Functions backend application `apps/api`
    - **UI**: React frontend application `apps/ui-community`
    - **Docs**: Documentation site using Docusaurus `apps/docs`

- **Library Packages**:
    - **Cellix**: Core framework and seedwork libraries used across projects `packages/cellix/*`
    - **Ocom**: Application-specific libraries used by frontend and backend `packages/ocom/*`

Open any file in the `apps/` or `packages/` directory and start exploring: the project uses hot reloading for rapid development!
