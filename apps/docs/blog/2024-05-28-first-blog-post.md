Welcome to CellixJs, a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) monorepo built on Azure Functions with GraphQL/REST APIs and MongoDB persistence. This framework provides a modern approach to building scalable applications with clear separation of concerns.

CellixJs implements a multi-layered architecture following strict DDD principles with bounded contexts for community management and user administration. The project includes specialized packages like `@ocom/domain` for business logic, `@ocom/graphql` for GraphQL implementation, and various service packages for MongoDB connectivity and observability.
